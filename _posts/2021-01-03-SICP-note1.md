摘选自MIT课程[计算机程序的构造和解释（SICP）Lec3a](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Xx41117tr?t=443&p=5)，这一段教我们用语言层面思考我们所做的东西，或者说“业务”：



> 关于系统的结构 一种更普遍的观点将其视作创建一种语言
>
> OK, there's a more general point about the structure of the system as creating a language,
>
> 将工程设计过程看作是创建一门语言
>
> viewing the engineering design process as one of creating language or
>
> 准确来说 是创建各种层次的语言
>
> or rather one of creating a sort of sequence of layers of language.
>
> 众所周知 有一种方法学 或者叫做“神话学”
>
> You see, there's this methodology, or maybe I should say mythology,
>
> 姑且叫做软件“工程”
>
> that's, sort of, charitably called software, quote, engineering.
>
> 它声称 你要先计算出你的任务
>
> All right, and what does it say, it's says well, you go and you figure out your task,
>
> 精确且正确地计算出你的任务
>
> and you figure out exactly what you want to do.
>
> 一但你搞清楚要做的东西
>
> And once you figure out exactly what you want to do,
>
> 你把它划分为三个子任务
>
> you find out that it breaks out into three sub-tasks,
>
> 然后你开始继续做--
>
> and you go and you start working on--
>
> 你开始处理这个子任务 然后你明确它是什么
>
> and you work on this sub-task, and you figure out exactly what that is.
>
> 这个子问题就分裂成三个子任务 你把它们处理完
>
> And you find out that that breaks down into three sub-tasks, and you specify them completely,
>
> 然后你先处理这两个任务
>
> and you go and you work on those two, and you work on this sub-one, and you specify that exactly.
>
> 解决完子任务后 你后退到这里 处理第二个子任务
>
> And then finally when you're done, you come back way up here, and you work on your second sub-task,
>
> 然后把它详细地实现出来
>
> and specify that out and work it out.
>
> 结束之后-- 你完成了这个美丽的大厦
>
> And then you end up with-- you end up at the end with this beautiful edifice.
>
> 你最后得到了一棵非凡的树
>
> Right, you end up with a marvelous tree,
>
> 你把任务划分为子任务 子任务再划分为子任务
>
> that where you've broken your task into sub-tasks and broken each of these into sub-tasks and broken those into sub-tasks, right.
>
> 树中的每个结点都被严谨而准确地定义
>
> And each of these nodes is exactly and precisely defined
>
> 为奇妙而精美的任务 以构建整栋大厦
>
> to do the wonderful, beautiful task to make it fit into the whole edifice
>
> 这个就是所谓的“神话学”
>
> Right, that's this mythology.
>
> 只有计算机科学家才可能相信你构建的复杂系统像这个样子
>
> See only a computer scientist could possibly believe that you build a complex system like that
>
> 好了 我们用Henderson的例子来做对比
>
> Right. Contrast that with this Henderson example.
>
> 它的结构不是那样
>
> It didn't work like that.
>
> 事实是：这里有一个语言的层次序列
>
> What happened was that there was a sequence of layers of language.
>
> 它是什么？
>
> What happened?
>
> 这里有一层 允许我们构建基本图像
>
> There was a layer of a thing that allowed us to build primitive pictures.
>
> 这个语言描述基本图像
>
> There's primitive pictures and that was a language.
>
> 我们并没有做过多地讨论
>
> I didn't say much about it.
>
> 我们讨论了如何构造George
>
> We talked about how to construct George,
>
> 这个语言是在单位正方形中讨论点、线和向量
>
> but that was a language where you talked about vectors and line segments and points and where they sat in the unit square.
>
> 而在这之上
>
> And then on top of that, right, on top of that--
>
> 这是讨论基本图像的语言
>
> so this is the language of primitive pictures.
>
> 讨论在特定单位正方形中线段的构造
>
> Right, talking about line segments in particular pictures in the unit square.
>
> 在这个上面是另一个完整的语言
>
> On top of that was a whole language.
>
> 关于几何组合子的语言
>
> There was a language of geometric combinators,
>
> 关于几何物件的位置
>
> a language of geometric positions,
>
> 讨论像ABOVE、BESIDE、RIGHT-PUSH和ROTATE这样的东西
>
> which talks about things like Above and Beside and right-push and Rotate.
>
> 这些事情恰巧与我们在这个语言中谈论的事情有关
>
> And those things, sort of, happened with reference to the things that are talked about in this language.
>
> 再细化一点 我们发现在这之上
>
> And then if we like, we saw that above that
>
> 还有一门语言 描述组合的模式
>
> there was sort of a language of schemes of combination.
>
> 比如说PUSH
>
> For example, push,
>
> 也就是用一个放缩因子重复地做一件事儿
>
> which talked about repeatedly doing something over with a scale factor.
>
> 我们在那门语言中讨论的问题
>
> And the things that were being discussed in that language
>
> 正是我这里构建的东西
>
> were, sort of, the things that happened down here.
>
> 我们在每一层上所讨论的对象
>
> So what you have is, at each level, the objects that are being talked about
>
> 都是前一个层次所建立的
>
> are the things that were erected the previous level.
>
> 这个和这个有什么区别呢？
>
> What's the difference between this thing and this thing?
>
> 这是因为
>
> The answer is
>
> 实际上在这里 树的每一个结点 每一次分解
>
> that over here in the tree, each node, and in fact, each decomposition down here,
>
> 都是旨在分成确定的任务
>
> is being designed to do a specific task,
>
> 而在另一个方案中
>
> whereas in the other scheme,
>
> 你在每个层级上的完完全全的语言层面的能力
>
> what you have is a full range of linguistic power at each level.
>
> 这里的每一个层次
>
> See what's happening there, at any level,
>
> 都不是被设计为完成一个特定任务
>
> it's not being set up to do a particular task.
>
> 它被设计为讨论整个事情
>
> It's being set up to talk about a whole range of things.
>
> 这样设计导致的结果是：
>
> The consequence of that for design
>
> 用这种设计方法更加健壮
>
> is that something that's designed in that method is likely to be more robust,
>
> 我所谓的“健壮”是指
>
> where by robust, I mean
>
> 当你在描述中做一些改变
>
> that if you go and make some change in your description,
>
> 我们可以做出相应的改变
>
> it's more likely to be captured by a corresponding change,
>
> 用上一层语言实现的方法改变即可
>
> in the way that the language is implemented at the next level up,
>
> 因为你让每个层次都是完全的
>
> right, because you've made these levels full.
>
> 所以你不需要讨论像BESIDE这样的特定操作
>
> So you're not talking about a particular thing like Beside.
>
> 你为表达这类事物创造了完备的词汇
>
> You've given yourself a whole vocabulary to express things of that sort,
>
> 所以当你轻微修改规格指标时
>
> so if you go and change your specifications a little bit,
>
> 这种方法论可以捕捉并适应那些变化
>
> it's more likely that your methodology will able to adapt to capture that change,
>
> 然而这种设计却不够健壮
>
> whereas a design like this is not going to be robust,
>
> 因为 如果我在这里改变一下
>
> because if I go and change something that's in here,
>
> 那可能会影响我划分这些东西的方式 严重地影响
>
> that might affect the entire way that I decomposed everything down, further down the tree.
>
> 分解观点的最大不同在于 按层次还是严格继承分解
>
> Right, so very big difference in outlook in decomposition, levels of language rather than, sort of, a strict hierarchy.
>
> 不只是如此 当你有多个层次的语言时
>
> Not only that, but when you have levels of language
>
> 你就有了不同的词汇储备
>
> you've given yourself a different vocabularies
>
> 用于讨论不同层次上的设计
>
> for talking about the design at different levels.
>
> 我们再回过头来看看George
>
> So if we go back and look at George one last time,
>
> 如果我想改变图像George
>
> if I wanted to change this picture George,
>
> 我立马得到了一种不同的方式来描述变化
>
> see suddenly I have a whole different ways of describing the change.
>
> 比如 我想在基本设计的层面上 移动某些向量的终点
>
> Like for example, I may want to go to the basic primitive design and move the endpoint of some vector.
>
> 我会在最底层讨论这个改变
>
> That's a change that I would discuss at the lowest level.
>
> 我会另外指定终点位置
>
> I would say the endpoint is somewhere else.
>
> 我也可以说 我想在这个小的重复元素上做文章
>
> Or I might come up and say, well the next thing I wanted to do, this little replicated element,
>
> 我可能想做些其它操作
>
> I might want to do by something else.
>
> 我想在BESIDE中使用一个缩放因数
>
> I might want to put a scale factor in that Beside.
>
> 这个改变我会在更高的层次上讨论：在组合子的层次
>
> That's a change that I would discuss at the next level of design, the level of combinators.
>
> 我也可以改变图像的基本组合模式
>
> Or I might want to say, I might want to change the basic way that I took this pattern
>
> 做一些递归地分解 可能不会让它们填充满角落
>
> and made some recursive decomposition, maybe not bleeding out toward the corners or something else.
>
> 而这样的一个变化 我会在最高层次讨论
>
> That would be a change that I would discuss at the highest level.
>
> 正是因为我按这种结构组织系统
>
> And because I've structured the system to be this way,
>
> 我有所有的词汇 可以用不同的方式描述变化
>
> I have all these vocabularies for talking about change in different ways
>
> 而且可以灵活地决定哪个更合适
>
> and a lot of flexibility to decide which one's appropriate.
>
> 这就是Lisp中不同于软件工程方法论的最大要点
>
> OK, well that's sort of a big point about the difference in software methodology that comes out from Lisp,
>
> 它来自于这样一个观点：真正的设计过程
>
> and it all comes again, out of the notion that really, the design process
>
> 与其说是在设计程序 不如说是在设计语言
>
> is not so much implementing programs as implementing languages.
>
> 而这就是Lisp的力量
>
> And that's really the power of Lisp.

> 谢谢大家 下课

> OK, thank you. Let's take a break.
